# hack.commit.push Paris June 15, 2019

## What is this about?

In the spirit of [the Hackergarten events](http://hackergarten.net/), we want to invite developers this summer to beautiful Paris to get a full day together supporting open source projects, by fixing issues and adding new features. And most of all, learn and have fun.

## Code of Conduct

It is an inclusive, open, non-profit event, aimed at collaboration and education. 

We value the right of every attendee to be not discriminated or harrassed. 
If you feel unsafe, please find one of the organizers and we will help you and address the issue with the other party.

Our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct) details the rules we stand by.
